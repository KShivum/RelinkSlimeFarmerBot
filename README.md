# RelinkSlimeFarmerBot
Used to farm msp and xp and stuff from slimepede
I'll make an exe later ig, crude afk bot, pretty strict but works.
I do not condone actual cheating, use at your own risk. Mainly as a fun side project to see how afk bots are made, this is no different than an autoclicker or using a turbo button.
